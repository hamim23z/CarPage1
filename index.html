                <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. is an Italian brand and manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. My dream Lamborghini is the newly released Lamborghini Urus. It is the first SUV Lambo and reaches high speeds. </p>

                <p>Automobiles Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909. My dream Bugatti is the Veyron 16.4. Bugatti is known for being the fastest and one of the most expensive cars ever. Every car is always over $1,000,000.</p>

                <p>Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1939. My dream Ferrari is the 488 Pista. I want this in the red colorway as it is widely known and Ferrari is recognized for its luxury. This is rarely seen in the United States so it would be amazing to have.</p>

                <p>Aston Martin Lagonda is a British independent manufacturer of luxury sports cars. Its predecessor was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. This is not a company you hear a lot about because it is underrated compared to Bugatti and Lamborghini. However, this company is known for its sleek design and luxurious looks. My dream car is the DBS in a blue colorway.</p>

                <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a luxury automobile maker. Rolls-Royce operates from purpose administrative and production facilities. Now this, is a retirement car. Many people own this car when they are in retirement, going to vacation, and enjoying life. From a built in umbrella to stars on the roof, they have everything. My dream car is the Rolls Royce Ghost in a black colorway.</p>

                <p>Mercedes-Benz, is a German luxury automotive brand. Both Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-Benz AG are headquartered in Stuttgart. You see Mercedes almost everywhere you go, but you rarely see this model. The Mercedes Maybach is a $300,000+ vehicle made just for luxury. This is a car that I dream of having if I cannot acquire a Rolls Royce because it is so beautiful.</p>
