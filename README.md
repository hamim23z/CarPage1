# Car Page - Version 1 Project

### Project Recap

A landing page for my favorite and dream cars. These are just some of my dream cars that are more on the expensive side.
Another basic website that I had created.  This is part one of my car website series. This is essentially just a showroom for various different car brands, but much less than car page 2. 
This is a fully responsive website and can be viewed across multiple different devices.
